Express.js is a web framework of Node JS save you some time and effort
set of components designed to simplify the web dev process (convention over configuration)

 - the framework dictates how it should be used.
 - speeds up the startup process of app development.
 - enforces best practices for the framework's use case
 - lack of flexibility.

 Unopinionated Web Framework (dev sets the rule)
  - The dev dictates how to use the framework
  - Offers flexibility to create an application unbound by any use case
  - No "Right Way" of structuring an application
  - Abundance of options may be overwhelming.
